It then mixes ideas from symbolic computational algebra systems with causal and acausal equation-based modeling frameworks to give an extendable and parallel modeling system. It allows for users to give a high-level description of a model for symbolic preprocessing to analyze and enhance the model. Automatic transformations, such as index reduction, can be applied to the model before solving in order to make it easily handle equations would could not be solved when modeled without symbolic intervention.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"To install ModelingToolkit.jl, use the Julia package manager:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"using Pkg\nPkg.add(\"ModelingToolkit\")","category":"page"},{"location":"#Citation","page":"Home","title":"Citation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"If you use ModelingToolkit in your work, please cite the following:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"@misc{ma2021modelingtoolkit,\n      title={ModelingToolkit: A Composable Graph Transformation System For Equation-Based Modeling},\n      author={Yingbo Ma and Shashi Gowda and Ranjan Anantharaman and Chris Laughman and Viral Shah and Chris Rackauckas},\n      year={2021},\n      eprint={2103.05244},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.MS}\n}","category":"page"},{"location":"#Feature-Summary","page":"Home","title":"Feature Summary","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"ModelingToolkit.jl is a symbolic-numeric modeling package.
